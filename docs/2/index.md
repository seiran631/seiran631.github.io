A capable woman, a perfect woman.

That is Kyomoto Haruki.

Everything was going smoothly.

Well-liked by her colleagues and the focus of their admiration, her situation completely changed when Mizuno Asuka, a junior from her school days and also her arch-nemesis, appears before her.

If only you hadn't shown up...

The sloppy Kyomoto who maintains the facade of a perfect office lady, and the elusive, mysterious Mizuno.

Set in the HR Department of a major IT company Deep Application, their relationship becomes entangled and begins to change.

※Although there are romance involving men, the story is ultimately yuri.
